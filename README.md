# libft
My very first own C library that will makes it easy to me working on the future projects.

## Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project allows me to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help me with all my future C projects.
I will keep working on expanding this library throught the years.

## Technology
  * C
  * Makefile
